1. npx create-react-app app_name

2. set up react folders/files

3. npm start --> run app 

4. npm install --save axios (to make a get request to the API for weather Data.)

5. create a folder (api) and inside api folder create a file (fetchWeather)

6. export the fetchWeather component to use in App.js 

7. after completing the src folder files now jump to public folder

8. inside public, delete all files except index.html

9. inside index.html underneath the div id="root" write a script 

10. check if serviceWorker is valid/available if yes then add a eventlistener

11. serviceWorker is just a js file which gives a promise => then or catch

12. open inspects in browser and go to applications section

13. inside application --> Service Workers --> enable (update on reload)

14. clear all data from clear storage

15. Service Worker successfully registered

16. now go serviceworker.js file in project

17. CACHE_NAME => it's browsers cache memory once we search for something we don't need to search for the whole process once it comes in cache memory.

18. next write urlsToCache => offline.html shows what will our app look like in offline version

19. Now we need to type three different events 

20. First one is installation

21 after completing the serviceWorker.js, go offline.html

22. after that create a new manifest.json

23. setup index.html

24. npm run build

25. this generates a build folder which we can drag and drop on netlify a fully production ready
app that bundles all the files from react that can be upload on netlify
